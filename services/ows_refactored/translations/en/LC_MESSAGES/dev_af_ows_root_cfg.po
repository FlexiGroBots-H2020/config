msgid "layer.s2_l2a.title"
msgstr "Surface Reflectance Sentinel-2"

#. Surface reflectance is the fraction of incoming solar radiation that is
#. reflected from Earth's surface. Variations in satellite measured radiance
#. due to atmospheric properties have been corrected for, so images acquired
#. over the same area at different times are comparable and can be used readily
#. to detect changes on Earth’s surface.  DE Africa provides Sentinel 2
#. Level-2A surface reflectance data from European Commission's Copernicus
#. Programme. Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission that systematically
#. acquires optical imagery at up to 10 m spatial resolution. The mission is
#. based on a constellation of two identical satellites in the same orbit, 180°
#. apart for optimal coverage and data delivery. Together, they cover all
#. Earth's land surfaces, large islands, inland and coastal waters every 3-5
#. days. Each of the Sentinel-2 satellites carries a wide swath high-resolution
#. multispectral imager with 13 spectral bands.  This product has a temporal
#. coverage of 2017 to current and is updated as new images are acquired.
#. Images in different spectral bands are provided at spatial resolutions of
#. 10, 20 or 60 m. The surface reflectance values are scaled to be between 0
#. and 10,000.  Sentinel-2 Level-2A data are provided by the European Space
#. Agency (ESA).  Data prior to 2017 are processed from Level-1C to Level-2A
#. with ESA's Sen2Cor software by Sinergise. All images are converted to Cloud
#. Optimised GeoTIFF format by Element 84, Inc.  For more information on the
#. Sentinel-2 Level-2A surface reflectance product, see
#. https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/level-2a/algorithm
#. This product is accessible through OGC Web Service
#. (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/), for analysis in DE Africa Sandbox

msgstr "Surface Reflectance Annual GeoMAD Sentinel-2"

#. Individual remote sensing images can be affected by noisy data, such as
#. clouds, cloud shadows, and haze. To produce cleaner images that can be
#. compared more easily across time, we can create 'summary' images or
#. 'composites' that combine multiple images into one image to reveal the
#. median or 'typical' appearance of the landscape for a certain time period.
#. One approach is to create a geomedian. A geomedian is based on a
#. high-dimensional statistic called the 'geometric median' (Small 1990), which
#. effectively trades a temporal stack of poor-quality observations for a
#. single high-quality pixel composite with reduced spatial noise (Roberts et
#. al. 2017). In contrast to a standard median, a geomedian maintains the
#. relationship between spectral bands. This allows further analysis on the
#. composite images, just as we would on the original satellite images (e.g. by
#. allowing the calculation of common band indices like NDVI). An annual
#. geomedian image is calculated from the surface reflectance values drawn from
#. a calendar year.  In addition, surface reflectance varabilities within the
#. same time period can be measured to support characterization of the land
#. surfaces. The median absolute deviation (MAD) is a robust measure (resilient
#. to outliers) of the variability within a dataset. For multi-spectral Earth
#. observation, deviation can be measured against the geomedian using a number
#. of distance metrics.  Three of these metrics are adopted to highlight
#. different types of changes in the landscape: - Euclidean distance (EMAD),
#. which is more sensitive to changes in target brightness. - Cosine (spectral)
#. distance (SMAD), which is more sensitive to changes in target spectral
#. response. - Bray Curtis dissimilarity (BCMAD), which is more sensitive to
#. the distribution of the observation values through time.  More techincal
#. information about the GeoMAD product can be found in the User Guide
#. (https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/GeoMAD_specs.html)
#. This product has a spatial resolution of 10 m and is available annually for
#. 2017 to 2020.  It is derived from Surface Reflectance Sentinel-2 data. This
#. product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data 2017-2020.  Annual
#. geomedian images enable easy visual and algorithmic interpretation, e.g.
#. understanding urban expansion, at annual intervals. They are also useful for
#. characterising permanent landscape features such as woody vegetation. The
#. MADs can be used on their own or together with geomedian to gain insights
#. about the land surface, e.g. for land cover classificiation and for change
#. detection from year to year.  For more information on the algorithm, see
#. https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2723896 and

#. Individual remote sensing images can be affected by noisy data, such as
#. clouds, cloud shadows, and haze. To produce cleaner images that can be
#. compared more easily across time, we can create 'summary' images or
#. 'composites' that combine multiple images into one image to reveal the
#. median or 'typical' appearance of the landscape for a certain time period.
#. One approach is to create a geomedian. A geomedian is based on a
#. high-dimensional statistic called the 'geometric median' (Small 1990), which
#. effectively trades a temporal stack of poor-quality observations for a
#. single high-quality pixel composite with reduced spatial noise (Roberts et
#. al. 2017). In contrast to a standard median, a geomedian maintains the
#. relationship between spectral bands. This allows further analysis on the
#. composite images, just as we would on the original satellite images (e.g. by
#. allowing the calculation of common band indices like NDVI). An semiannual
#. geomedian image is calculated from the surface reflectance values drawn from
#. a 6 month period.  In addition, surface reflectance varabilities within the
#. same time period can be measured to support characterization of the land
#. surfaces. The median absolute deviation (MAD) is a robust measure (resilient
#. to outliers) of the variability within a dataset. For multi-spectral Earth
#. observation, deviation can be measured against the geomedian using a number
#. of distance metrics.  Three of these metrics are adopted to highlight
#. different types of changes in the landscape: - Euclidean distance (EMAD),
#. which is more sensitive to changes in target brightness. - Cosine (spectral)
#. distance (SMAD), which is more sensitive to changes in target spectral
#. response. - Bray Curtis dissimilarity (BCMAD), which is more sensitive to
#. the distribution of the observation values through time.  More techincal
#. information about the GeoMAD product can be found in the User Guide
#. (https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/GeoMAD_specs.html)
#. This product has a spatial resolution of 10 m and is available semiannually
#. for 2019 to 2020.  It is derived from Surface Reflectance Sentinel-2 data.
#. This product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data 2019-2020.
#. Semiannual geomedian images and the MADs are useful for characterizing
#. landscapes with seasonal changes.  For more information on the algorithm,
#. see https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2723896 and

#. in a 1 to 1 relationship with the input satellite data. Hence there is one
#. WOFL for each satellite dataset processed for the occurrence of water.  This
#. product has a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal coverage of 2013 to
#. 2019.  It is derived from Landsat 8 satellite observations as part of a
#. provisional Landsat Collection 2 surface reflectance product.  Daily water
#. observations can be used to map historical flood and to understand surface
#. water dynamics.  WOfS shows surface water on the day and time that satellite
#. passed overhead, which might be before, during or after a flood peak. Given
#. the time between satellite passes (approximately once every 16 days) it is
#. unlikely that the satellite will capture the maximum extent of any given
#. flood. Instead, it aims to provide large scale, regional information on
#. surface water.  For more information on the algorithm, see

#. landscape, where water is seldom observed, and where inundation has occurred
#. occasionally. Data is provided as Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs),
#. in a 1 to 1 relationship with the input satellite data. Hence there is one
#. WOFL for each satellite dataset processed for the occurrence of water.  This
#. product has a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal coverage of 1980s to
#. current.  It is derived from Landsat Collection 2 surface reflectance
#. product.  Daily water observations can be used to map historical flood and
#. to understand surface water dynamics.  WOfS shows surface water on the day
#. and time that satellite passed overhead, which might be before, during or
#. after a flood peak. Given the time between satellite passes (approximately
#. once every 16 days) it is unlikely that the satellite will capture the

#. Cropland Extent Map for Eastern Africa
#: 
msgid "layer.crop_mask_eastern.title"
msgstr ""

#. Digital Earth Africa's cropland extent map for Eastern Africa shows the
#. location of croplands in the countries of Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia,
#. Rwanda, and Burundi. Cropland is defined as: "a piece of land of minimum
#. 0.04 ha (a single 10m x 10m pixel) that is sowed/planted and harvest-able at
#. least once within the 12 months after the sowing/planting date." This
#. definition will exclude non-planted grazing lands and perennial crops which
#. can be difficult for satellite imagery to differentiate from natural
#. vegetation.  This provisional cropland extent map has a resolution of 10m,
#. and was built using Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2019 and
#. 2020. The cropland extent map was produced using extensive training data
#. from Eastern Africa, coupled with a Random Forest machine learning model.
#. For a detailed exploration of the methods used to produce the cropland
#. extent map, read the jupyter notebooks in DE Africa’s crop-mask github
#. repository.  An independent validation dataset suggests this product has an
#. overall accuracy of 90.3 %. The algorithm tends to report more omission
#. errors (labelling actual crops as non-crops) than commission errors
#. (labelling non-crops as crops). Where commission errors occur they tend to
#. be focussed around wetlands and seasonal grasslands (e.g. in the Serengeti)
#. which spectrally resemble some kinds of cropping.  The product contains
#. three bands: - mask: This band displays cropped regions as a binary map.
#. Values of 1 indicate the presence of crops, while a value of 0 indicates the
#. absence of cropping. This band is a pixel-based cropland extent map, meaning
#. the map displays the raw output of the pixel-based Random Forest
#. classification. - prob: This band displays the prediction probabilities for
#. the 'crop' class. As this product used a random forest classifier, the
#. prediction probabilities refer to the percentage of trees that voted for the
#. random forest classification. For example, if the model had 200 decision
#. trees in the random forest, and 150 of the trees voted 'crop', the
#. prediction probability is 150 / 200 x 100 = 75 %. Thresholding this band at
#. 50 % will produce a map identical to mask. - filtered: This band displays
#. cropped regions as a binary map. Values of 1 indicate the presence of crops,
#. while a value of 0 indicates the absence of cropping. This band is an
#. object-based cropland extent map where the mask band has filtered using an
#. image segmentation algorithm. During this process, segments smaller than 1
#. Ha (100 10m x 10m pixels) are merged with neighbouring segments, resulting
#. in a map where the smallest classified region is 1 Ha is size. The filtered
#. dataset is provided as small commission errors are removed by this process,
#. and the 'salt and pepper' effect typical of classifying pixels is
#. diminished.  More techincal information about the GeoMAD product can be
#. found in the User Guide
#. (https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Cropland_extent_specs.html)
#. Cropland extent maps are a foundational, baseline layer in high-order crop
#. health and crop productivity products which necessarily rely on knowing
#. where cropping occurs before further analysis can take place.  This product
#. is accessible through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/),

#. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model
#: 
msgid "layer.dem_srtm.title"
msgstr ""

#. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a digital representation of Earth’s
#. topography. It helps to understand the land surface characteristics in the
#. height dimension. It is also used as an ancillary dataset to calculate
#. illumination and viewing geometry of a satellite imagery. DE Africa provides
#. access to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) v 3.0 (SRTMGL1)
#. product.  This elevation model has a spatial resolution of 30 m and is
#. derived from data collected by NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in
#. 2000.  It is provided by NASA's Land Processes Distributed Active Archive
#. Center (LP DAAC).  For more information, see
#. https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/  This product is accessible
#. through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/), for analysis in
#. DE Africa Sandbox JupyterLab
#. (https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki) and
#. for direct download from AWS S3 (https://data.digitalearth.africa/).

#. Fractional Cover (Prototype)
#: 
msgid "layer.fc_ls.title"
msgstr ""

#. Fractional cover describes the landscape in terms of coverage by green
#. vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn,
#. dry grass, etc.) and bare soil. It provides insight into how areas of dry
#. vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time.
#. This product has a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal coverage of
#. 1980s to current.  It is derived from Landsat Collection 2 surface
#. reflectance product.  Fractional cover allows users to understand the large
#. scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and
#. policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon
#. dynamics, land surface process monitoring, land management practices,
#. vegetation studies, fuel load estimation, ecosystem modelling, and rangeland
#. condition.  The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote
#. Sensing Research Program, for more information see
#. http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Seasonal+Fractional+Cover
